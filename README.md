"# Cryptography" 
I went on a tanget from my cryptocurrency course. Took a basic TCP client, server code from a previous project and added AES encyption and created digital signatures to prevent messages to be read and changed by an attacker. tcpmallory is the "man-in-the-middle" in this case. TO RUN: start w/ server, mallory, client in this order.
